      <p>Jo has a right passion for typing.  Attending only a small primary school, Jo’s first typing lessons comprised of a printed keyboard on a sheet of paper, finally progressing to a ‘real’ manual typewriter in high school, and then to electronic typewriters and computers throughout high school, college and business school. Jo set two typing speed records within two educational institutions in the Wide Bay and has refined her skill to a fine art.</p>
      <p> She now spends a lot of time listening to recorded audio voices to be transcribed to text, including: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Sales representative client discussions </li>
        <li> University lectures </li>
        <li> Seminars and webinars </li>
        <li> Interviews </li>
        <li> To-do lists </li>
