  <H1> I Hear Voices </h1>
  <p> Jo has a right passion for typing.  Attending only a small primary school, Jo’s first typing lessons comprised of a printed keyboard on a sheet of paper, finally progressing to a ‘real’ manual typewriter in high school, and then to electronic typewriters and computers throughout high school, college and business school. Jo set two typing speed records within two educational institutions in the Wide Bay and has refined her skill to a fine art.</p>
  <p> She now spends a lot of time listening to recorded audio voices to be transcribed to text, including: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Sales representative client discussions </li>
    <li> University lectures </li>
    <li> Seminars and webinars </li>
    <li> Interviews </li>
    <li> To-do lists </li>
    <li> Thoughts that pop into clients’ heads while on the road </li>
    <li> Job interviews </li>
    <li> Psychologist and clinician’s sessions </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote> Ut eum veniam dicunt virtute, an noster voluptua convenire mei. At sed tollit scaevola, an maiorum repudiare per. Mei epicuri apeirian ne, usu iisque aliquam praesent ad, omnes ullamcorper in pri. Vitae quaeque mea cu. Mei quot laoreet laboramus eu, cu propriae patrioque maiestatis vel. </blockquote>
