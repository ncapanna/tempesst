I transcribe interviews, focus groups for research, university lectures, therapist consultations and every now and then,    a YouTube video, plus many other types of voice recordings.One of my objectives   when I transcribe is to have as few [inaudible] *00:00:34 or [over talk] 00:00:35
                            time stamps, or [I cannot quite understand what the speaker is saying] *00:00:37 throughout the
                             document. Sometimes these are simply unavoidable, but can be quite easily prevented when
                            recording your audio.
                                 Listening to a recorded conversation is remarkably different to actually being in the room. If you
    r               egularly record audio files for transcribing, or if you are considering embarking on this time saving
    service, below are some tips on how to ensure you receive an accurate representation of the
    recording, make the most of your dollars per minute and to prevent rework or corrections when you
    receive the typed document in return.</p></div>
