                        <p class="blogtext">I type between 100,000 to 150,000 words per week. Most of this involves the transcription of audio recordings to an electronic document. I transcribe interviews, focus groups for research, university lectures, therapist consultations and every now and then, a YouTube video, plus many other types of voice recordings.</p>
